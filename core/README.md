# CI/CD
## GitLab CI
The GitLab CI pipeline runs validation, build and tests.  
The pipeline is run on every push to `develop`, `staging` and `master`/`main` branches, as well as on every merge request.  
The build stage runs a different flavor depending on the branch:  
- `develop` runs the `development` flavor
- `staging` runs the `staging` flavor
- `master`/`main` runs the `production` flavor

If the pipeline is run on a merge request, the test stage will add the test coverage to it. Additionally, the pipeline will output code coverage reports.

### Setup for iOS builds
For iOS builds, having a GitLab Runner running macOS is required. Please refer to the [GitLab documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/install/osx.html) for setup instructions if you don't have one yet. Then follow [Manage Runners](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/runners/runners_scope.html) to set up the runner for your project. During the `mason make` dialog you will be prompted to enter the tag configured for the runner after you chose `GitLab CI` as your automation service provider.  

### Configuration
The pipeline is defined in `.gitlab-ci.yml`, while the build stage is defined in `templates/build.yml`.  
- Flutter version: Make sure to update the `FLUTTER_VERSION` variable to the version of Flutter you want to use. 
- Image: By default, [cirruslabs Flutter Docker images](https://github.com/cirruslabs/docker-images-flutter/pkgs/container/flutter) are used. If you want to use a different image, update the `FLUTTER_DOCKER_IMAGE` variable.
